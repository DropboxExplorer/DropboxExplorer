##User Experience
The first screen the user sees is the Dropbox sign in screen. This is customized with your own icon and application name within your Dropbox configuration. All credentials are managed by Dropbox so there is no security risk due to poor management of confidential data.

Once signed in, the dialog looks very similar to the standard Windows dialogs. A familiar toolbar offers Back and Up buttons as well as a crumb-bar that enables a rapid method for returning to a higher level folder.

The dialog optionally provides automatic asynchronous file transfers. Alternatively the file transfer functions are directly exposed so the calling application can manage the transfer in a non-modal way if desired.
